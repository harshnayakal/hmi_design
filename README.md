# hmi_design
This Python code creates an HMI (Human-Machine Interface) using Tkinter and Matplotlib. It features a GUI with buttons to "Start," "Stop," and "Monitor" a system. The Matplotlib plot visualizes data, while the "Monitor" button fetches real-time CPU and memory usage using the psutil library.
